Sure, here's a brief overview of each topic in TypeScript with examples:

1. **Functions:**
   Functions in TypeScript can be defined using the `function` keyword followed by the function name, parameters, and return type (optional). Here's an example:

   ```typescript
   function add(a: number, b: number): number {
       return a + b;
   }
   ```

2. **Callback Functions:**
   Callback functions are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed after the completion of a specific task. Here's an example:

   ```typescript
   function fetchData(callback: (data: string) => void) {
       // Simulating fetching data
       const data = "Some data";
       callback(data);
   }

   fetchData((data) => {
       console.log("Data received:", data);
   });
   ```

3. **Promises:**
   Promises represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. Here's an example of using promises:

   ```typescript
   function fetchData(): Promise<string> {
       return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
           // Simulating fetching data asynchronously
           setTimeout(() => {
               const data = "Some data";
               resolve(data);
           }, 2000);
       });
   }

   fetchData().then((data) => {
       console.log("Data received:", data);
   }).catch((error) => {
       console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
   });
   ```

4. **Arrays:**
   Arrays in TypeScript can hold elements of the same or different types. Here are some array examples:

   ```typescript
   // Array of numbers
   let numbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

   // Array of strings
   let fruits: string[] = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];

   // Array of mixed types
   let mixed: (number | string)[] = [1, "two", 3, "four"];
   ```

5. **Variables and Data Types:**
   TypeScript supports various data types such as `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `object`, `array`, `tuple`, `enum`, `any`, `void`, `null`, and `undefined`. Here are some examples:

   ```typescript
   // Variables and data types
   let num: number = 10;
   let str: string = "Hello";
   let bool: boolean = true;
   let obj: object = { key: "value" };
   let arr: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
   let tuple: [number, string] = [1, "one"];
   let enumValue: number = Color.Red;
   let anyValue: any = 10;
   let voidValue: void = undefined;
   let nullValue: null = null;
   let undefinedValue: undefined = undefined;

   enum Color {
       Red,
       Green,
       Blue
   }
   ```

These examples provide a basic understanding of these concepts in TypeScript. You can further explore each topic in more detail as needed.

Casting in TypeScript, also known as type assertion, is the process of explicitly converting a variable from one type to another. TypeScript offers two ways to perform casting:

1. **Angle Bracket Syntax**: This syntax resembles casting in other languages like Java and C#. It is also known as "angle-bracket syntax."

   ```typescript
   let variable: any = "123";
   let length: number = (<string>variable).length;
   ```

2. **As Keyword**: TypeScript also provides the `as` keyword for type assertion, which is the preferred method in TypeScript.

   ```typescript
   let variable: any = "123";
   let length: number = (variable as string).length;
   ```

   The `as` syntax is more readable and less prone to conflicts with JSX in TypeScript.

Casting is commonly used in scenarios such as:

- When you know more about a value's type than TypeScript does.
- When you want to temporarily treat a value as a different type.

However, casting does not change the underlying type of the variable at runtime. It is only a compile-time mechanism to inform the TypeScript compiler about the variable's type.

It's important to use casting judiciously, as improper casting can lead to runtime errors if the actual type of the variable is not compatible with the asserted type.

Here's a summary of TypeScript casting:

- **Purpose**: Explicitly convert a variable from one type to another.
- **Syntax**: Angle bracket syntax (`<type>variable`) or `as` keyword (`variable as type`).
- **Use Cases**: When you know more about a value's type or when temporarily treating a value as a different type.
- **Precaution**: Improper casting can lead to runtime errors if the actual type of the variable is not compatible with the asserted type.

Remember to always prefer the `as` keyword for type assertion in TypeScript as it provides better readability and compatibility with JSX syntax.
